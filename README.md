# 30-Days-Of-JavaScript

This is a collection of my solutions to the [JavaScript30 online course by wesbos](https://javascript30.com/) building 30 mini projects in 30 days to gain a clearer understanding of javascript DOM manipulation. 

Anyone is free to use these as they wish. If you see any mistakes or have a recommendation for an improvement feel free to send them over!
